# In the data science, there exists the concept of stemming, which is heuristic of chopping off the end of a word to clean and bucket it into an easier feature set.
# Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence, write a function replace_words to stem all the words in the sentence with the root forming it. If a word has many roots that can form it, replace it with the root with the sortest length.
Example:
Input:
root = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output:
"the cat was rat by the bat"

def replace_words(root, sentence):
  words = sentence.split()
  j=0
  while j<len(words):
    i = 0
    while i<len(words[j]):
      if words[j][:i] in roots:
        words[j] = words[j][:i]
        i = len(words[j])
      i = i+1
    j = j+1
  new_sentence = " ".join(words)
  return(new_sentence)

# Write a function find_change to find the minimum number of coins that make up the given amount of change cents.
# Assume we only have coins of value 1,5,10, and 25 cents.
Example:
Input:
cents = 73
Output:
def find_change(cents) -> 7
#(25+25+10+10+1+1+1)

def minimum_change(cents):
  count = 0
  while cents != 0:
    if cents >= 25:
      count +=1
      cents -=25
    elif cents >=10:
      count +=1
      cents -=10
    elif cents >= 5:
      count +=1
      cents -=5
    elif cents >=1:
      count +=1
      cents -=1
  return count
